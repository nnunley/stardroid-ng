Please use multiple subagents to work on the one most important task for this project in order to create MVP of this app on an android device.

- Use kotlin as the programming language.
- Use modern built tooling
- If there's not a spec to work with, create one.
- If you're working on a spec, create a checklist of tasks to complete it.
- Prioritize tasks that unblock other tasks.
- Always work in small units. Always commit your work using the jj-workflow skills.
- Always review your code, and test it thoroughly.
- If you get stuck, ask for help, including asking for more specs to be created.
- Once you finish your selected task, update the file status.md with your progress, and exit.
